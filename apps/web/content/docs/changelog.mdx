## February 2026 - Dev Playground

A new **developer playground** is now available at `/playground` during local development.

- **Block browser** — Browse and preview all 35 registered blocks with category grouping, variant switching, viewport controls (desktop/tablet/mobile), and theme toggling.
- **Sandbox mode** — Test new components in isolation by editing `components/blocks/previews/_sandbox/scratch.tsx`. Changes reflect live via HMR.
- **Dev-only** — The playground is only accessible when `NODE_ENV=development` and returns a 404 in production builds.
