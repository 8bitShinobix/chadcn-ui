## Adding Blocks

There are two ways to add blocks to your project:

### Using the CLI

The recommended way to add blocks:

<PackageInstall command="npx @chadcn/cli add auth/login" />

This command will:

1. Download the block code
2. Install required dependencies
3. Add the block to your `components/blocks/` directory

### Manual Copy

You can also copy code directly from our documentation:

1. Navigate to the block you want
2. Click the "Copy" button in the code panel
3. Paste into your project
4. Install any required dependencies manually

## Block Variants

Many blocks come with multiple variants:

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minimal` | Clean, essential design with minimal styling |
| `standard` | Balanced design suitable for most use cases |
| `feature-rich` | Full-featured with all bells and whistles |

To add a specific variant:

<PackageInstall command="npx @chadcn/cli add auth/login --variant minimal" />

## Customization

Every block is designed to be customized. Here's a typical customization workflow:

### 1. Add the Block

<PackageInstall command="npx @chadcn/cli add auth/login" />

### 2. Locate the Component

The block will be added to your project:

```
components/blocks/auth/login-form.tsx
```

### 3. Modify the Code

Open the file and customize as needed:

```tsx
export function LoginForm() {
  // Customize the form fields
  // Add your authentication logic
  // Modify the styling
}
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  Since you own the code, you can make any changes you want. There's no need to override styles or work around library limitations.
</Callout>

## Working with Forms

Many blocks include forms with validation. We use:

- **React Hook Form** for form state management
- **Zod** for schema validation

Example form setup:

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { z } from "zod"

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
})

type FormData = z.infer<typeof schema>

export function LoginForm() {
  const form = useForm<FormData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  })

  const onSubmit = (data: FormData) => {
    // Handle form submission
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Styling

Blocks use Tailwind CSS for styling and follow the shadcn/ui theming system. To customize colors:

1. Modify your `globals.css` CSS variables
2. The blocks will automatically use your theme

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
    --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
    --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
    /* ... other variables */
  }
}
```
