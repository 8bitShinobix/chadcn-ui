## What is chadcn?

chadcn is a collection of **35+ beautifully designed, production-ready UI blocks** (105 variants) built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Unlike traditional component libraries, chadcn provides complete, ready-to-use sections that you can drop directly into your SaaS application.

<Callout variant="tip">
  chadcn components are designed to work seamlessly with existing shadcn/ui installations. If you're already using shadcn/ui, you can add chadcn blocks without any conflicts.
